# Features, Bugs, and Other Enhancements
All ideas, potential bugs and other enhancements are welcome. Please do your best to provide a detailed description, and hopefully you should have a response in a few days.

Please submit ideas and bugs through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/apowers313/open-element-template/issues).

# Pull Requests
If you are willing to put in the effort for a Pull Request, it would be ideal to submit the idea as a [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/apowers313/open-element-template/issues) first. This allows at least a little back-and-forth to make sure that the idea is viable, well thought out, and fits with the existing architecture and roadmap.

Commits for pull requests should use the [Commitizen](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/) `git cz` format, which creates the conventional commits that drive semantic-release and conventional-changelog. 

Please test your pull request before sending it! The best way to do this is to clone your repo: `git clone /path/to/local/files`. Then run `npm install` to run the configuration script and `npm test` to make sure the configuration worked. If you set the environment variable `INIT_DEFAULTS=1` before `npm install` you won't have to work through all the configuration questions.

If you have any questions, feel free to email me.
